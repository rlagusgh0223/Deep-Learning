# Deep Learning
This is repository for Deep Learning by using Tensorflow and Keras.
</br>
## Desciption
In this my study for specialization, I hope to build and train neural network architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, LSTM and GRU. 
And also learn how to make them better with strategies.
</br>
In this repository, I have a plan to master theoretical concepts and thire industry applications using Python and TensorFlow and tackle real-world cases such as speech recognition, music synthesis, chatbots, machine translation, natural language processing, and more.
<br/>
#### I put most of things for imporving my knowledege not for teaching knowledge to somebody that's what this repository is all about.
